# Remote Party Finder Reborn - Dalamud Plugin

A Dalamud plugin that collects Party Finder listings from FFXIV and synchronizes them to a remote server.

## Disclaimer

This is a fork of the [original Remote Party Finder project](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/remote-party-finder)'s client part by zeroeightysix.

**Note**: This plugin is a proof of concept created for personal interest. There are no plans for a public release.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data Collection**: Scans in-game Party Finder listings and transmits them to the server.
- **Crowd Sourcing**: Contributes local PF data to the centralized web view.
- **Leader Info Collection**: Gathers party details for FFLogs integration on the server side.

## Configuration

The plugin is configured to send data to a specific server endpoint. Check `Configuration.cs` or the in-game plugin settings to point it to your local or hosted server instance.

### Tomestone API

Tomestone official API integration is owned by the plugin. The Tomestone API key is stored locally in plugin configuration and is sent only as an `Authorization: Bearer` token to official `tomestone.gg` API requests.

When Tomestone phase progress enrichment is enabled, the plugin submits additive phase progress data to the configured RPF server. The server caches submitted progress and includes it in listing snapshots; it does not proxy official Tomestone API calls.

Tomestone failures, missing data, 404s, malformed responses, and rate limits do not block FFLogs result upload. Tomestone `429` responses use the plugin-local Tomestone cooldown, separate from FFLogs cooldown behavior.

The Tomestone web/Inertia fallback is only for FFLogs-style percentile fallback data and is unrelated to official API progression enrichment.

### Recommended Worker Timing Presets

The FFLogs worker timing values are available in the plugin debug tab.

These values are provisional starting points (not derived from controlled production benchmarking yet).
Adjust them based on your own measured endpoint behavior and failure patterns.

| Preset | `Base Delay` | `Idle Delay` | `Max Backoff` | `Delay Jitter` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Low-load / personal server | 5000 ms | 12000 ms | 60000 ms | 1500 ms |
| Balanced (default) | 5000 ms | 10000 ms | 60000 ms | 2000 ms |
| High-load / API-sensitive | 8000 ms | 15000 ms | 90000 ms | 2500 ms |

- `Base Delay` controls retry backoff base and disabled/misconfigured wait interval.
- `Idle Delay` controls polling interval when no jobs are returned.
- `Max Backoff` caps retry delay after repeated transient failures.
- `Delay Jitter` reduces synchronized spikes when many clients poll together.

Circuit breaker defaults (`Failure Threshold=3`, `Break Duration=1 min`) are a good baseline and should usually be tuned only if your endpoint is frequently rate-limited.
